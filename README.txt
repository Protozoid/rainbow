Rainbow BBCode Generator script made in Lua.

rainbow.lua is a simple recreational "proof of concept" script. Uses a basic procedure to generate a pseudo-rainbow.

~/bin directory contains the executable. 
~/src directory contains source code file.

Dependencies are either a Lua 5.1 VM to be present on your machine (to run from the raw source, or to run the executable out-of-the-box independent of the
lua51 DLL). Otherwise (running the executable), make sure the distributed dynamic link libraries (lua51.dll & lua.5.1.dll) is in the same directory as the running program.

Refer to LICENSE file for licensing terms. Refer to TODO for a general roadmap or agenda for future refinements.

Note: Be sure to check out the download in this repo for the binary.
